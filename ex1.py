#my first program

print "hello world" 
print "hello again"
print "I like typing this"
print "this is fun."
print 'Yay! Printing'
print "I'd much rather you 'not'."
print 'I "said" do not touch this.'

# A comment, this is so you can read your python later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by python.

print 'I could have code like this.' # and the comment after is ignored

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
# print 'this won't run.'
print 'This will run.'
